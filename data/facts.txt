Microglial activation plays a central role in mediating neuroinflammatory responses.
Neuroinflammation is linked to memory loss in aging and neurodegenerative disease.
Perineuronal nets regulate critical period closure and long-term synaptic stability.
Low levels of estradiol impair hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation.
Aromatase activity in the hippocampus influences local estrogen synthesis.
BDNF is essential for synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation.
Chronic stress downregulates BDNF expression in the hippocampus.
Excess cortisol exposure disrupts memory encoding in the prefrontal cortex.
Sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal function and memory consolidation.
Default mode network disruptions are observed in Alzheimer’s disease.
Synaptic pruning is mediated by activated microglia during early development.
Oxidative stress contributes to neural damage in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Social isolation elevates neuroinflammatory markers and impairs cognition.
Estradiol has neuroprotective effects against excitotoxicity and inflammation.
White matter decline contributes to reduced cognitive processing speed in aging.
Cognitive overload impairs executive function and working memory.
Environmental enrichment promotes neurogenesis and cognitive flexibility.
Tau pathology disrupts synaptic integrity and correlates with memory decline.
Vascular dysfunction reduces cerebral perfusion and impairs learning.
Hippocampal atrophy is strongly associated with episodic memory deficits.
