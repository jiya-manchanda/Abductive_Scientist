Microglial activation plays a central role in mediating neuroinflammatory responses.
Neuroinflammation is linked to memory loss in aging and neurodegenerative disease.
Perineuronal nets regulate critical period closure and long-term synaptic stability.
Low levels of estradiol impair hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation.
Aromatase activity in the hippocampus influences local estrogen synthesis.
BDNF is essential for synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation.
Chronic stress downregulates BDNF expression in the hippocampus.
Excess cortisol exposure disrupts memory encoding in the prefrontal cortex.
Sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal function and memory consolidation.
Default mode network disruptions are observed in Alzheimer’s disease.
Synaptic pruning is mediated by activated microglia during early development.
Oxidative stress contributes to neural damage in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Social isolation elevates neuroinflammatory markers and impairs cognition.
Estradiol has neuroprotective effects against excitotoxicity and inflammation.
White matter decline contributes to reduced cognitive processing speed in aging.
Cognitive overload impairs executive function and working memory.
Environmental enrichment promotes neurogenesis and cognitive flexibility.
Tau pathology disrupts synaptic integrity and correlates with memory decline.
Vascular dysfunction reduces cerebral perfusion and impairs learning.
Hippocampal atrophy is strongly associated with episodic memory deficits.

Perineuronal nets (PNNs) significantly restrict synaptic plasticity by inhibiting synapse formation. The digestion of PNNs has been associated with short-term cognitive improvements and reduced long-term memory, offering potential therapeutic
Evidence is strong that, in addition to fine motor control, there is an important role for the cerebellum in cognition and emotion. We explore the development and role of perineuronal nets and the in vivo and in vitro evidence
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) structures found throughout the central nervous system that regulate plasticity. They consist of a heterogeneous mix of ECM components that form lattice
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan-containing structures on the neuronal surface that have been implicated in the control of neuroplasticity and memory. Age-related reduction of
Advanced physiological aging is associated with impaired cognitive performance and the inability to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiological correlate of memory. Here, we demonstrate in the physiologically aged, senescent mouse brain that
