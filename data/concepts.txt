memory_loss: A decline in the ability to encode, store, or retrieve information, often associated with hippocampal atrophy, synaptic dysfunction, or neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s disease.
impaired_learning: A deficit in acquiring or consolidating new knowledge or behaviors, linked to disrupted long-term potentiation (LTP), reduced neurogenesis, or executive function deficits.
forgetfulness: Behavioral expression of memory decay or interference, commonly due to impaired hippocampal consolidation or attentional filtering failure.
academic_decline: Observable decrease in cognitive performance, memory retention, or attentional regulation, often influenced by environmental stressors, fatigue, or emotional dysregulation.
hippocampal_atrophy: A reduction in the structural volume of the hippocampus, associated with age-related memory deficits, PTSD, and neurodegenerative disorders.
default_mode_disruption: Dysregulation of the brain’s default mode network, leading to disorganized internal thought, impaired memory encoding, and attentional dysfunction.
executive_dysfunction: Impaired goal-directed behavior and working memory due to prefrontal cortex disruption; observed in ADHD, traumatic brain injury, and depression.
