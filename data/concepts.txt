memory_loss: decline in the brain's ability to recall or retrieve information, commonly seen in neurodegeneration
impaired_learning: reduced ability to acquire new knowledge, often due to structural or functional neural changes
disruption(pnn): breakdown of perineuronal nets, which protect neurons and support plasticity
microglial_activation: a reactive immune state of microglia, the brain's primary immune cells
neuroinflammation: inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, often involving activated microglia
chronic_stress: prolonged psychological stress that dysregulates hormones and impairs cognition
aromatase_suppression: inhibition of the enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens in the brain
low(neurosteroid_levels): reduced concentration of hormones like estradiol that regulate brain function
aging: biological process associated with decline in neural plasticity and hormone production
academic_decline: measurable reduction in learning performance, attention, or memory retention
